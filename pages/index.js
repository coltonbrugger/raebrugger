            <p>
              On December 25, 2021, Christmas Day afternoon, Lowell Julian
              Brugger, 85, died at his home in La Grange, Texas surrounded by
              his loving family. He was known to many as “Buddy” Brugger, and
              lovingly called “Papa” by his eleven grandchildren and nine
              great-grandchildren.
            </p>
            <p>
              The youngest of 4 children, Lowell was born to Johnny and Norma
              Brugger in La Grange, Texas. He grew up between the farm in
              Halsted and their home in La Grange.
            </p>
            <p>
              Lowell married Rae in Mexico, honeymooned with her on a journey to
              Alaska, and enjoyed much travel across the States with his wife,
              children, and grandchildren. His career and outdoorsmen hobbies
              were strongly rooted in Texas.
            </p>
            <p>
              Lowell had worked in Construction since his teens. An accomplished
              and respected craftsman, Lowell built homes, apartments, office
              buildings and cabins with an artistic eye all over Texas. In and
              around Fayette County, he has a great many satisfied customers.
            </p>
            <p>
              When taking a short break from work, he could religiously be found
              visiting with friends and any other passersby at the Donut Shop in
              the mornings or at the ‘Dairy Mart’ (later DQ) in the afternoons.
            </p>
            <p>
              On his longer breaks from work, he’d often be traveling to hunt
              for his big buck out in West Texas, fishing at a nearby lake, or
              fishing from the beach or pier along the Gulf coast. It was with
              photos and trophies from all his hunting, fishing, and other trips
              that Papa filled his game room. His game room will long remain the
              best place for family and friends to look back on those cherished
              memories.
            </p>
            <p>
